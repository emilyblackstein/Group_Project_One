# Group Project Outline
## Our project aims to create a predictive analysis tool that estimates the future value of different currencies based on certain inputs. We will look to estimate these currencies based on inputs such as oil prices, government debt, net exports, and R&D. In order to achieve this, the data we choose should reflect the correlation between the identified inputs and exchange rate trends in the past. 

## Possible Sources of Data Include: 

-	API
-	World Bank
-	Asian Development Bank
